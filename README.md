## 💻 About

Editor - This project was created using the same technologies as the new front-end being built at Rocketseat (Next.JS and StitchesJS).

His intention was to further test the Remirror tool to create an editor with some more features, such as choosing a theme for the code block or tagging users, so that the team could have an example a little more similar to what we want to apply.
